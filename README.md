# Research (Machine learning framework for pixel trading )

## Introduction

  There are some significant similarity behavior of pixels and website ad-blocks in online advertising market with stocks and companies in stock market. Based on that observation, we are trying to design a trading model for pixels. This trading model should be functionally self maintainable (trading decisions should generate itself) by learning from the market behaviors. Within this research we are suppose to design a machine learning framework for this trading model.
