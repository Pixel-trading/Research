# Research (Machine learning framework for pixel trading )

## Introduction

  There are some significant similarity behavior of pixels and website ad-blocks in online advertising market with stocks and companies in stock market. Based on that observation, we are trying to design a trading model for pixels. This trading model should be functionally self maintainable (trading decisions should generate itself) by learning from the market behaviors. Within this research we are suppose to design a machine learning framework for this trading model.

## Pixel trading concept 

  A self maintainable trading platform that feeding from Ad-exchange and facilitate to investors to for website ad-blocks aunder the atomic pixel level and design new vertual market based on this mechanisum.
